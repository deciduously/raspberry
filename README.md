#Raspberry Dashboard#
I bought a raspberry pi, and want something fun, useful, and educational to run on it.  I wanted to learn Django.  And also needed a central spot to store other side projects.  So, this is a fun little Django project designed to run on my raspberry pi and serve as a central spot to store other side projects!  It will also provide a web frontend for the fileserver on the pi.

This is a quick and dirty implementation of **Pandemic: The Cure**, the dice-based version of the popular board game.

I am in this to learn me some Javascript/jQuery, *not* to infringe any IP, and only intend to use this personally.

It's a wonderful game and if you find this repo, you should do yourself a favor and go play it!
