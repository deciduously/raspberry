This is an introductory Django project which I hope to eventually deploy on a Raspberry Pi 3 on my LAN running Arch Linux ARM, using Nginx and PostgreSQL.

#Currently Included Projects#

## Dice ##

This is a quick and dirty implementation of **Pandemic: The Cure**, the dice-based version of the popular board game.

I am in this to learn me some Javascript/jQuery, *not* to infringe any IP, and only intend to use this personally.

It's a wonderful game and if you find this repo, you should do yourself a favor and go play it!

#### Currently used external libraries ####

* [jQuery](http://jquery.com/) 2.2.0

#### TODO ####

* Finish basic functionality
* Design interface that doesn't make me cry myself to sleep
* Enable multiplayer, both hotseat and via internet
* Cry myself to sleep
