## Dice ##

This is a quick and dirty implementation of **Pandemic: The Cure**, the dice-based version of the popular board game.

I am in this to learn me some Javascript/jQuery, *not* to infringe any IP, and only intend to use this personally.

It's a wonderful game and if you find this repo, you should do yourself a favor and go play it!
